# Chess AI (C#)
This repo is a fork of Sebastian Lague's [chess coding challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge), which was a friendly competition in which your goal was to create a small chess bot (in C#) using the framework provided in this repository. 
In this fork I have created my own chess bot based on the Minimax algorithm. I have done a similar project in Python, which can be found [here](https://github.com/AnmolS99/Chess-AI). The aim of this project is to create an even more efficient and stronger chess bot
than the one I created in Python.

## Playing against the chess AI ðŸŽ®

* Try building and running the project.
  * If a window with a chess board appears â€” great!
  * If it doesn't work, take a look at the FAQ/troubleshooting section at the bottom of the original repo README page. You can also search the [issues page](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge/issues) to see if anyone is having a similar issue.
